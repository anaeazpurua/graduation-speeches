                <p class="article__text">Some of 2023's most inspiring commencement speeches painted a world full of challenges, a very scary world indeed. At the same time, speakers expressed their confidence in this generation. They said there is hope because the graduates in front of them could find solutions to our most pressing problems.</p>
                    
                <p class="article__text">I analyzed <strong>three popular commencement speeches</strong>, featured in <a class="dotted_link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/31/commencement-speeches-graduation-2023-tom-hanks-oprah-winfrey">The Guardian</a>, <a class="dotted_link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmylucas/2023/06/06/the-best-career-advice-from-2023s-top-graduation-speeches/?sh=627d14f04451">Forbes</a>, and other media outlets. These were the words most frequently used by each speaker. You can find the code in my <a class="dotted_link" href="https://github.com/anaeazpurua/graduation_speeches">Github repository</a>. </p>

                In his <a class="dotted_link" href="https://www.harvard.edu/media-relations/2023/05/25/tom-hanks-commencement-speech/">speech</a> to Harvard University's newest graduates, the actor Tom Hanks referred to them as “newly incorporated members of the <b style="color:#363fc7";">Justice</b> League of Avengers,” everyday superheroes who can fight the “agents of intolerance.” 
            </p>        
            
            <p class="article__text">
                “We'd like to look up in the sky and see not a bird, not a plane, but, well, someone young, strong, and super, who'll fight the never-ending battle for Truth, for <b style="color:#363fc7";">Justice</b> and for the <b style="color:#363fc7";">American way</b> --someone who will take on that work,” the actor said. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="article__text">
                Two of his 10 most frequently used words were <b style="color:#363fc7";">Way</b> and <b style="color:#363fc7";">American</b>, often used together: the <b style="color:#363fc7";">“American Way.”</b> Hanks said it is rooted in telling the truth but warned about its opposites: “Omission. (You don't need to know that!) Distraction (That's not the real story! This is!) Opinion masquerading as clairvoyance (Here's what is going to happen!) and influence peddling (you know, a lot of people are saying…).”
            </p>

            <p class="article__text">
                But of all of them, the nemesis of <b style="color:#363fc7";">truth</b> is indifference, Hanks urged. He asked graduates to never stop caring and embrace “liberty and freedom for ALL.”
